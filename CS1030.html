<h3>Data Tools</h3>
<p>Data sets can be stored in text files, spreadsheets, or databases. The simplest way to store data is in a text file which is very limited. A more common format is comma-separated values (CVS) which is considered “tabular” data since it includes rows and columns. Spreadsheet applications are programs for analyzing data which can import files such as CVS data. This application is easy to use without programming experience. Databases are commonly used to store data for several applications and users. A database usually contains different types of data and multiple tables. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most commonly used query language to pull data from a database. SQL and spreadsheets are the most popular ways to analyze data.</p>


<h3>Big Data</h3>
<p>Data sets are constantly growing and are many times now referred to as big data. The benefit of big data is to be able to access more information which can be further analyzed. The downside is that new ways had to be found to store and access this data since it is too large for how data has been stored in the past. There are several examples of where big data can come from. Some examples are scientific research, digital libraries, medical records, and user-facing applications. Data centers which are comprised of computers and data storage devices, are a way of storing these large data sets. Processing these data sets is challenging and engineers can use different avenues such as parallel computing to decrease processing time. We all have to ensure that this data is being used ethically.</p>

<h3>Bias in Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Machine learning is an algorithm which obtains knowledge by processing data and constantly improves its output. There are different types of machine learning. Neural network is an approach of supervised machine learning. The input goes through a layered process using neurons which leads to an output. The neural network is trained by huge amounts of data which is labeled and used as a reference point. This data is important for the accuracy of the output. Unfortunately, this data can be biased due to the training data being intentionally or unintentionally biased. This bias must be considered especially when making decisions within the context of criminal justice and making hiring decisions.</p>

<h3>Unit Test</h3>
<p>The unit test provided a good overview of my understanding of the different sections of the unit. Some questions certainly were easier to answer especially when they were more straight forward. The quizzes helped prepare for the unit test. The descriptions of why an answer was correct or incorrect helped me understand the concepts.</p>
